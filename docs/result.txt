+msgid "``pyfemtet.opt`` has a GUI tool to visualize the optimization result."
+msgid "If you successfully ran `onestop-installer`, you already have the GUI tool."

+msgid "Launch GUI"
+msgid "Double click desktop icon."
+msgid "Before launch tool, you run an optimization and get ``.csv`` file that contains the optimization history."
+msgid "Then Launch the tool and Femtet and load csv."
+msgid "Finally, you can select each solution plot and open corresponding FEM result in Femtet."
+msgid "To learn usage with ready-made sample project, you can use `demo mode` in tool. It starts few minutes journy to explain how to use the tool."
+msgid "Script Builder"
+msgid "``pyfemtet.opt`` has a GUI tool for script builder to run optimization: ``pyfemtet-opt-gui``."
+msgid "More information, see :doc:`../installation_pages/install_pyfemtet` or :ref:`manualinstallation` ."
+msgid "It may takes a long time for first time launching."
+msgid "Before launch tool, you prepare a .femprj file that define the FEM problem with parametric modeling and parametric analysis output settings."
+msgid "Then Launch the tool and setup optimization problem following the tool's explanation."
+msgid "Finally, you will get a ``.py`` script to run optimization with your ``.femprj`` file."
+msgid "Manual Installation"

+msgid "If you have no icon on your desktop, search `pyfemtet-opt.exe` in `Scripts` folder of your python environment."
+msgid "To check where your python environment is, run following command in `cmd`::"
+msgid "The command above returns full path of your `python.exe` file. Typically the `Scripts` folder exists in where the `python.exe` exists."
